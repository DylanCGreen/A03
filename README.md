Tutorial:                             
GITHUB is an opens source control system that allows multiple people to work on one document, below is a small tutorial on how to create and edit a document in GITHUB:            
1. Create a repository: A repository will hold a single project to edit and you can create one by selecting + and "New repository."
You can give the repository a name, a short description, and select "Initialize this repository with a README."
2. Create a branch for your repository:  To make a new branch, click the drop-down that says, "branch: master" and type in a name for a new branch and click, "create new branch." A branch can be used to work on multiple versions of a repository. At first the repository only contains the "master" branch. Creating another branch allows you to work on the document without changing the master branch until you are ready to pull in your updates.                      
3. Edit the repository: To make changes, use the README.md file and click on the pencil on the top right to edit.        
4. Commit Changes: Once you have made the edits you wish to make, scroll to the bottom where it says, "Commit changes." Add a commit message in the text box describing the edits made, click "commit changes."         
5. Open a Pull Request: Click the "pull request" tab and click "New pull request" and from there look at the Example Comparisons box to compare with the master branch. Once you are good with the edits, click, "Create Pull Request" and give your pull request a title and description. Pull requests allow users to suggest changes to a document that someone else in a group can pull into a branch.    
6. Merge the pull request: In the master branch click, "Merge pull requests" and if there are no merge conflicts, click "Confirm merge." Merge conflicts occur if the two branches have competing commits meaning they cannot work together.         
7. You have successfully created and editted a repository in GITHUB. Below are some key terms and other features in GITHUB.
